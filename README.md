# Tomatimely
A simple Pomodoro timer. Check out the [Live version](http://www.tomatimely.com).

# Why Tomatimely?
I've used countless Pomodoro timer apps and websites and they would all be lacking in features I wanted.
Some would have keyboard shortcuts, others would have statistics, others again would look great on mobile.
But none had all of them.
I've created Tomatimely to address this frustration.
Tomatimely is the perfect Pomodoro timer for me and I hope you'll find it pleasant to use as well.

This project was bootstrapped with the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
